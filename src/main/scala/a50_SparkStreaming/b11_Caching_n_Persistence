      +  persist()
      
   #  Window based operations
      +  Is persist() ed by default
      +  Example
         -  reducByWindow()
         -  reduceByKeyAndWindow()
         
   #  State based operations
      +  Is persist() ed by default
      +  Example
         -  updateStateByKey
         
                     
         
   #  Input stream that receive data over N/W
      +  Default Persistence level replicated date 2 nodes for fault tolerance
      +  Example Input Streams  
         -  Kafka, Flume etc...
      
   #  Serialized
      +  In DStreams(unlike RDD), default persistence level keeps the data
         serialized in Memory

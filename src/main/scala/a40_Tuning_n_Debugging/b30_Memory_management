General
------------------------------------------

   #  Executor Memory is used for,
      +  RDD Storage                   #158
      +  Shuffle & Aggregation Buffers
      +  User Code
     
   #  Default Allocation of Executor Memory
      +  RDD                              60%
      +  Shuffle & Aggregation Buffers    20%
      +  User Program                     20%  

Cache Options
------------------------------------------

   #  MEMORY_ONLY,
      +  Disadvantage
         -  Recomputation
            .  Old RDD partition are removed(So it needs to be recomputed when needed)
               from Cache if there is no space to Cache new Partition
      
   #  MEMORY_AND_DISK 
      +  Example :   If we are reading from ***Database, makes a lot of sense to not
                     allow recomputation
      
   #  MEMORY_ONLY_SER
      MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER
      +  This caches the Serialized object instead of the actual Object
      +  Advantage
         -  Garbage collection time(Pauses) in JVM can be reduced  #158
      +  Scenario
         -  When large amout of data is cached

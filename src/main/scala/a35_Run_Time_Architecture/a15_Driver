   #  Can be launched using,
      +  'spark-submit'

   #  Runs in,
      +  Local Machine (or)
      +  Inside the Cluster (Believe Possible only in YARN & Stand-alone Cluster Manager)
      
   #  Creates Task
      +  Converts the User program into 'Task'(Which are executed in 'Executors')
      +  Steps
         -  User program ->
         -  DAG of Operations ->
         -  Stages   ->
         -  Tasks (Tasks are bundled & prepared to be sent to Cluster)
         
   #  Schedule Tasks on Executors
   #  Track Cached Data
      +  RDDs cached by Tasks are tracked by Driver Program to scheduled future Tasks

   #  Accessible from,
      #  http://localhost:4040   (in Local mode)   #119

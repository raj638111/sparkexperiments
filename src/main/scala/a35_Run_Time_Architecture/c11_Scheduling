Inter Application Scheduling
----------------------------------------------------
  
   #  Done through, 
      +  Cluster Manager
      
   #  Where normally Happens?
      +  Multiple users running their own Application on the Cluster
      
   #  Fewer or More executors
      +  A Spark Application may receive fewer (or) more Executors from Cluster Manager
         depending on Cluster Availability
         
Intra Application Scheduling
----------------------------------------------------

   #  Done through,           #129
      +  Spark's internal 'Fair Scheduler'
   
   #  Where normally happens?
      +  In Applications that are long lived
      
   #  Example : Long Lived Application       
      +  JDBC Server Bundled with Spark SQL

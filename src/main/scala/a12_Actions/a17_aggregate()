aggregate[U](zeroValue: U)(seqOp: (U, T) ⇒ U, combOp: (U, U) ⇒ U)(implicit arg0: ClassTag[U]): U
Aggregate the elements of each partition, and then the results for all the partitions, using given combine functions and a neutral "zero value". This function can return a different result type, U, than the type of this RDD, T. Thus, we need one operation for merging a T into an U and one operation for merging two U's, as in scala.TraversableOnce. Both of these functions are allowed to modify and return their first argument instead of creating a new U to avoid memory allocation.
